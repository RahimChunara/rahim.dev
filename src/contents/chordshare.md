# Exploring Decentralized File Sharing with the Chord Algorithm

I recently worked on a project where I implemented a decentralized file sharing system using the Chord protocol. The motivation behind this was to address the challenges of traditional, centralized file sharing systems, which often suffer from single points of failure and scalability issues.

## Why Chord?

Chord is a well-known protocol that efficiently handles distributed hash tables (DHTs). It organizes nodes in a logical ring, allowing each node to locate files with minimal routing information. The protocol uses consistent hashing to map file identifiers to nodes, and each node maintains a finger table, a routing structure that helps it quickly find the responsible node for any file.

## Implementation Details

We chose Python for this project because of its cross-platform capabilities and ease of use. The main tasks were:

1. **Node Management**: We implemented dynamic node management so that nodes could join and leave the network smoothly. This ensured that the system could scale easily.

2. **File Availability**: To handle node failures, we used file replication. Files were replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring they remained accessible even if some nodes went down.

3. **Concurrency Control**: We added mechanisms to handle multiple users accessing the same files simultaneously, ensuring smooth and error-free operations.

## Results and Learning

Through testing, the system showed it could handle dynamic changes and efficiently distribute the storage load. The Chord protocolâ€™s design allowed for quick data lookups, often requiring only a few hops between nodes. The project confirmed the effectiveness of decentralized architecture for scalable and reliable file sharing.

While the project wasn't breaking new ground, it was an excellent learning experience in implementing existing concepts and understanding the nuances of decentralized systems. For anyone interested in distributed systems or looking to explore DHTs, Chord is a solid protocol to study.
